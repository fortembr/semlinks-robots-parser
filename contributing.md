# Contributing to SEM Links

## Guidelines

- **Node Version:**

  - Our projects all use Node Version Manager (NVM). To ensure consistency in versioning, we've included the NVM config file called `.nvmrc` in the root directory.
  - We also use this version to ensure that all NPM packages align with the Node version from this file.

- **Coding Standard:**

  - Linting errors are checked by [ESLint][link-eslint] and [Prettier][link-prettier].
  - Config files for ESLint (`.eslintrc.js`) and Prettier `.prettierrc` have been included at the root level.

- **Add Relevant Tests:**

  - All pull requests should include relevant tests to ensure the change works as expected and to prevent regression errors.
  - Test Types: [Types of Test for Developers][link-test-types].
  - Your code may be rejected for failure to include tests. Please be prepared to rectify this if you submit without tests.

- **Document Changes in Behaviour:**

  - Some of our projects rely on inline TypeScript documentation, powered by [TypeDoc][link-typedoc].
  - Some changes may also include GitHub `*.md` updates too.

- **One Pull Request per Feature/Bug/Issue:**

  - Our tracking for pull requests is based on the issues list.
  - One pull request per issue.

- **Send Coherent Comment History:**

  - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [rebase or squash them][link-git-rebase] before submitting.

## Running Tests

In order to contribute, you'll need to checkout the source from GitHub and
install dependencies using npm. The actual `npm test` commend will depend on which type of test you're running.

```
git clone https://github.com/carbondigitalus/<PROJECT>.git
cd <PROJECT>
npm install
npm test
```
